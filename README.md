# SpringMVCApp
Simple spring MVC application with one jUnit test (removed)


Run **mvn clean install** inside project folder.

Go to **target** subfolder after mvn finished. Take **tomcat.zip** file.

Unzip it where you want and go inside its **bin** folder. Start the **startup.bat** on Windows. Run your browser and open [http://localhost:8080/application](http://localhost:8080/application)

If you prefer UNIX like OS, before starting the server change the *.sh scripts mode by invoking inside bin folder **chmod u+x *.sh*. Then start **./startup.sh** and open the same URL.

IMPORTANT! You must have adequately installed JRE 7+ (or JDK 7+)


Good luck,
George
