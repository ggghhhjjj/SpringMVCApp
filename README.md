# SpringMVCApp
Simple spring MVC application with one jUnit test (removed)


Run mvn clean install
Go to target folder
Take tomcat.zip file
Unzip it where you want and go inside bin folder. Start the startup.bat on Windows. Run your browser and open http://localhost:8080/application/.
If you use UNIX like OS, before starting the server change the *.sh scripts mode by invoking inside bin folder chmod u+x *.sh. Then start ./startup.sh and open the same URL.

IMPORTANT! You must have adequately installed JRE 7+ (or JDK 7+)


Good luck,
George
